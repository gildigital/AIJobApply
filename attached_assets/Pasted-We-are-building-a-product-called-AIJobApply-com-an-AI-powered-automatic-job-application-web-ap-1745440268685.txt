We are building a product called **AIJobApply.com** — an AI-powered automatic job application web app that guides users from onboarding to resume analysis to a paid auto-apply experience.

The goal is to provide an onboarding experience that feels powerful, personal, and instantly useful — followed by a compelling upsell to upgrade and start automated job applications.

### Fixes from v0

✅ **Fix input types in onboarding**:
Demographic questions like:
- “Do you identify as transgender?”
- “Do you have a disability or chronic condition?”

Should use **radio buttons**, not checkboxes. Only one answer should be valid for these fields.
- Fix: Use `type="radio"` with a shared `name` attribute for these questions
- Multi-selects (e.g. race, gender identity, sexual orientation) should remain checkboxes

✅ **Highlight required vs optional questions** in onboarding with subtle UI cues (e.g. asterisk, italicized labels)

### New Features to Add

#### 📄 **PDF Resume Parsing**
- Allow users to upload a resume (PDF only)
- Use a placeholder parsing function (later we’ll use PyMuPDF or GPT)
- Extract the text and save it to the **user profile**
- Store as: `resumeText` inside the `users` table

#### 🧠 **User Summary Generator**
After resume upload:
- Run a basic OpenAI-powered function that creates a clever, human-readable “User Summary”
- Example output:  
  > *"USAF veteran, full-stack software engineer, and physics researcher with experience in Java, TypeScript, and distributed systems at Amazon. Passionate about applying AI to science and education."* 
- Show this summary prominently in the dashboard

#### 🧭 **Dashboard Upgrade**
After onboarding:
- Show:
  - Resume view/replace
  - User Summary
  - Application Answers
  - Job Tracker
- Add a **glowing CTA button**:  
  🟢 **Start Auto-Applying Now**
  - This button should link to the pricing page

### 💰 Pricing Page (But Better)

Design a pricing page inspired by the competitor's (see screenshot), but **cleaner and more modern**.

Features to include:
- Plan cards for: **2 Weeks**, **1 Month Silver**, **1 Month Gold**, **3 Months Gold** 
- Display:
  - Resume upload count
  - Daily auto-apply limits
  - GPT model tier (e.g. GPT-4o vs Claude mini)
  - Priority status
  - Refund policy (“30-day interview guarantee”) (WRITE A REFUND POLICY PAGE)
- Suggested layout:
  - 3 columns, evenly spaced
  - Highlight "Most Popular" plan
  - Use icons for features (✅ Resume uploads, ⚡ Priority Queue, 🤖 AI Models)
  - UX Copy: Emphasize outcome-driven headlines
    - e.g. “From No Response to Dream Job”, “AI That Applies for You”

Include a **Stripe checkout button** (mock integration OK).

### 💼 SaaS Funnel UX Strategy

We want users to:
1. Feel empowered by onboarding
2. See how polished their resume and profile look
3. Get excited by the AI-generated “User Summary”
4. Click the **Start Auto-Applying** button
5. Land on a pricing page that converts

This experience should create an “aha moment” followed by an upsell.

### Tech Stack Preferences (NO CHANGES UNLESS REQUIRED) 

- Frontend: React or Next.js + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- Auth: Email/password
- Backend: Node.js or Supabase
- Resume upload: Accepts `.pdf`, max 5MB
- GPT usage: Use mock `generateUserSummary(resumeText)` for now

---

You can scaffold this as a multi-page app:  (NO CHANGES UNLESS REQUIRED)  
- `/` – Landing page
- `/onboarding` – Full onboarding flow
- `/dashboard` – Shows resume + summary + job tools
- `/pricing` – Upsell with plan options
- `/success` – Checkout success page


Keep the design modular and conversion-oriented. Let’s build a SaaS that **feels magic before they even pay**.
