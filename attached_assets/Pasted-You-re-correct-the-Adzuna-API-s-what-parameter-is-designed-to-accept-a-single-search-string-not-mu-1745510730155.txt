You're correct—​the Adzuna API's what parameter is designed to accept a single search string, not multiple job titles separated by logical operators like "OR" or "|". This means that combining several job titles into one what parameter may not yield the desired results.​

Recommended Approach
To search for multiple job titles, you should make separate API requests for each job title. Here's how you can structure these requests:

1. Junior Software Engineer

2. Entry Level Software Engineer

3. Junior Full Stack Web Developer

Automating Multiple Requests
If you're developing an application or script, you can automate these multiple requests by iterating over a list of job titles. Here's a Python example:

python
Copy

import requests

app_id = '95ef062b'
app_key = '88cbd4c385b8612e8df9b16b05b4acca'
job_titles = [
    'Junior Software Engineer',
    'Entry Level Software Engineer',
    'Junior Full Stack Web Developer'
]
location = 'San Diego'

for title in job_titles:
    params = {
        'app_id': app_id,
        'app_key': app_key,
        'results_per_page': 20,
        'what': title,
        'where': location,
        'content-type': 'application/json'
    }
    response = requests.get('https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/us/search/1', params=params)
    data = response.json()
    # Process the data as needed
This approach allows you to handle multiple job title searches programmatically.

Additional Tips
Pagination: If you expect more than 20 results per job title, consider implementing pagination by adjusting the page number in the URL (e.g., /search/2, /search/3, etc.).​

Filtering: You can further refine your search using additional parameters like salary_min, full_time, permanent, etc. Refer to the Adzuna API documentation for a full list of available parameters.​
